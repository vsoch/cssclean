# Contributing

When contributing to the CSS Clean Library, it is 
important to properly communicate the gist of the contribution. 
If it is a simple code or editorial fix, simply explaining this 
within the GitHub Pull Request (PR) will suffice. But if this is a larger 
fix or Enhancement, it should be first discussed with the project
leader or developers.

Please note we have a code of conduct, described below. Please follow it in
all your interactions with the project members and users.

## Pull Request Process

1. Bug fix PRs should be sent to main.
2. Follow the existing code style precedent.
3. Test your PR locally, and provide the steps necessary to test for the reviewers.
4. The project's default copyright and header have been included in any new source files.
5. If necessary, update the README.md.
6. The pull request will be reviewed by others, and the final merge must be done by project lead, @vsoch (or approved by her).
