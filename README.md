# CSS Clean!

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/cssclean.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/cssclean)

This is a library for cleaning up css based on styles that are actually used in html files.
Although there are [libraries that use npm](https://www.keycdn.com/blog/remove-unused-css)
I am not a fan so I wanted something in Python.

## Approach

We take a conservative approach to filtering, meaning:

 - for any style block, one matching class or identifier is sufficient for inclusion
 - multiple levels selectors are not combined (e.g., using "button" is sufficient to add `.button. red`.
 - we always keep keyframes and imports. Additional parsing could be added to support checking, but they are fairly rare (imho).
 - The library is **new** and I may have missed a case! Please [open an issue](https://github.com/vsoch/cssclean/issues) if you find something.

Of course this could be improved upon but we would need more careful token parsing!
Please [open an issue](https://github.com/vsoch/cssclean/issues) if you are interested. 

## Usage

### Install

First, clone and install.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vsoch/cssclean
$ cd cssclean
$ pip install -e .
```

or install from pip.

```bash
$ pip install cssclean
```

And then try running an example! 

### Clean Directory

Below we ask cssclean to automatically detect files (css and html) under the same test directory:

```bash
$ cssclean clean --css cssclean/tests/testdata/1 --html cssclean/tests/testdata/1
Sheet style.css has 124 rules.
Sheet style.css filtered down to 43 rules.
1 files written:
  style.css => /home/vanessa/Desktop/Code/unused-css/cssclean/tests/testdata/1/style.clean.css
```

As you can see, by default, it will write the updated css files alongside the old files but with .clean added.
Note that you can provide individual files, one at a time too, for both of ``--css``
and ``--html``.

```bash
$ cssclean clean --css cssclean/tests/testdata/1 --html cssclean/tests/testdata/1/home.html --html cssclean/tests/testdata/1/table.html
```

### Dry Run

You can also do a dry run to print the filtered style to the screen:

```bash
$ cssclean clean --css cssclean/tests/testdata/1 --html cssclean/tests/testdata/1 --dry-run
...
.card.yellow {
  background-color: var(--color-yellow);
}
tr {
  background-color: white;
}
```

### Minify

And you can ask for the same preview, but minified:

```bash
$ cssclean clean --css cssclean/tests/testdata/1 --html cssclean/tests/testdata/1 --dry-run --minify
```

Or a non-preview minified:

```bash
$ cssclean clean --css cssclean/tests/testdata/1 --html cssclean/tests/testdata/1 --outdir ./out --minify
```
```bash
Sheet style.css has 124 rules.
Sheet style.css filtered down to 43 rules.
1 files written:
  style.css => ./out/style.clean.min.css
```

Note that "min" is added to the saved filename, and also note that this is experimental - I'll need to do
some more tests and reading to figure out what exactly the process is.

### Output Directory

You can also ask for a custom output directory:

```bash
$ mkdir out
$ cssclean clean --css cssclean/tests/testdata/1 --html cssclean/tests/testdata/1 --outdir ./out
```
```bash
Sheet style.css has 124 rules.
Sheet style.css filtered down to 43 rules.
1 files written:
  style.css => ./out/style.clean.css
```

## Example

As an example, I tested against the usrse site. We can render the site into ``_site``:

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll build
```

and then run the clean in place. Here is the original style file:

```bash
$ ls -l style.css 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dinosaur dinosaur 263390 Jun  4 20:57 style.css
```
We can then run the clean in place:

```bash
$ cssclean clean --css assets/css/style.css --html _site/ --in-place
Sheet style.css has 4080 rules.
Sheet style.css filtered down to 1380 rules.
1 files written:
  style.css => assets/css/style.css
```

And what is the new size?

```bash
$ ls -l style.css 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dinosaur dinosaur 201347 Jun  5 15:11 style.css
```

So there is a huge reduction in size when we first remove unused stuff (-62043 bytes)!
To summarize:

 - original: ~263KB
 - cleaned: ~201KB

And importantly, the site looks the same!

So personally, I don't have issue with the size differences between minified and cleaned - my preference is not to
minify so I can easily read it, but I can also imagine a workflow where you minify just for the production
site and the development version is just cleaned. It's really up to you!

## Contributors

We use the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) 
tool to generate a contributors graphic below.

## TODO

 - add tests for different cases
 - create GitHub actions - one to actually clean and one to detect (fail if unused)
 - automated release
 - some kind of summary command that shows used/unused styles, or the count
 - can we use asp to determine used rules?
